# GMU Personal Webpage
GMU provides anyone with a `@gmu.edu` email with 100MB of server space to host a personal webpage at no cost.

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure that you have access to your institutional email.
2. For Windows users, check that [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3) and [PuTTy](https://www.putty.org/) and  installed on your computer.
3. Download and install a text/code editor of your choice. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a reasonably lightweight editor with convenient features for any programming language (including Python, MATLAB, C/C++/C#, Wolfram, R, etc.). You'll use the editor to manage your files _locally_.
    - _Note: within VSCode, I suggest installing the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), which allows you to test your website on your own computer.
4. Download and install a **S**ecure **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (SFTP) client:
    - [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) for Windows _or_ macOS (_or_ *nix) users;
    - [Forklift 3](https://binarynights.com/) for macOS users _only_.
5. Download and install the [Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client](https://its.gmu.edu/service/virtual-private-network-vpn/), which allows you to access GMU's **V**irtual **P**rivate **N**etwork (VPN) while off-campus. _Note_: this is also required if you wish to access _any_ GMU resources (high-performance compute clusters, for example) when not connected to campus internet.
6. _(Optional)_ Familiarize yourself with the [basic `git` commands](https://www.atlassian.com/git), and set up a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
    - _Note: for Windows users, it is possible that `git` is not installed on your computer. [Here's an installation guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)!_
